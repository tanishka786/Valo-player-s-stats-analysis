# Valo Player Stats Analysis

This project performs a comprehensive analysis of the Valorant game dataset from Kaggle. The dataset is used to answer key questions, perform statistical analysis, and visualize insights about the game and its agents. Below are the key highlights and steps involved in the project:

## Project Structure
- **Dataset**: The Valorant dataset from Kaggle, containing data on agents, maps, players, teams, and weapons.
- **Analysis Methods**: Various statistical and machine learning techniques are applied, including:
  - Identifying the top 10 most popular agents in Valorant.
  - Applying Linear Regression for predictive modeling.
  - Building a Decision Tree classifier for both datasets.
  - Visualizing data insights using heatmaps.

## Project Goals

1. **Top 10 Most Popular Agents**: 
   - Analyze the dataset to identify and rank the most frequently used agents in Valorant.

2. **Linear Regression Analysis**: 
   - Apply linear regression to identify relationships between game statistics (like player performance) and other variables.

3. **Decision Tree Classifier**: 
   - Build a decision tree to predict outcomes and make data-driven decisions based on features from the datasets.

4. **Heatmap Visualizations**: 
   - Create heatmaps to visualize correlations between features in the dataset, providing insights into patterns and relationships.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Processing)
- Scikit-learn (Linear Regression & Decision Tree)
- Seaborn, Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
